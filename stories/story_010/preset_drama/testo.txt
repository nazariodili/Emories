The air crackled with anticipation, shadows dancing in the dim light. Last year, amidst the chaos of a world unraveling, I met her—Andrea. 

Time stood still when our eyes first locked, a moment suspended in eternity, a heartbeat echoing in the silence. We fell into each other’s orbit, two souls colliding against the backdrop of a tumultuous universe. 

Every laugh, every shared secret felt like a rebellion against the mundane. We wove a tapestry of dreams, bright threads against the encroaching darkness. 

Now, as the weight of our decision looms, I feel the gravity of our choice pressing down. Next year, we are getting married. The thought sends shivers through my spine, a mixture of exhilaration and dread, like the calm before a storm.

In this fleeting moment, I grasp the reality of our love—a love that defies the odds, that stands tall amidst the clamor of uncertainty. The Dies Irae swells, a haunting melody that mirrors the turbulence in my heart. This is it. This is our war.
