Years ago, amidst the vibrant energy of the Masters, I met Andrea. It was a moment that felt almost cinematic, the kind where time slows down and the world fades away. We shared laughter and stories, losing ourselves in the joy of each other's company. Each moment together felt like a scene from a beautiful film, filled with warmth and connection. 

Now, as the sun sets on this chapter of our lives, we are on the brink of something extraordinary. Next year, we will exchange vows, sealing our love in front of family and friends. The journey that began at the Masters has blossomed into a love story I canâ€™t wait to continue. The excitement of our upcoming wedding dances in the air, a promise of forever waiting to unfold.
